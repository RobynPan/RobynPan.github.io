        <h1>Roses Are LED</h1>
<br><br>
        <h6>A Rose, to shine when the world seems Dark</h6>
<br>
        <p>A piece I made in the darkness of winter to expand my understanding of phosphorescent pigment. The Idea is that Transparent phosphorescent petals surround a UV LED which is powered by solar panels in the same way as garden path lights. The Daylight charges the petals, which glow softly until full darkness, when the LED lights up, charging the petals up again from withing the heart of the rose.</p>

        <img alt="It's almost perfect. It was essential that the pocketwatch be slightly larger than the Moto360" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/ae8a04cec62ae97ecb9113b14b5e3fb7/tumblr_omiilwvmMV1tucmhwo1_1280.jpg" width="700px;" style="float: center;" />
        
        <p>However, when I recently got my hands on an old first Gen Moto 360, I certainly wasn't going to turn down the chance to try it out. I walked around with it on my wrist, but I've never really worn a wristwatch. Certainly not since the 90s. The ability to check (but not write)  my messages or emails didn't seem particularly stunning. I went online and found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/450fpr/running_a_full_featured_terminal_on_android_wear/">this</a> tutorial on how to install the terminal app <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a> on it. I was inspired. I could run around with a terminal on my wrist. I imagined using SSH to access any of my systems remotely from my watch. I set it up and bumped into the same issue as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/parkerlreed">parkerlreed</a>: no physical keyboard.</p>
        
        <p>Procrastinating that, I loved the idea of a terminal that small, that portable. I stopped wearing the watch most days though: I couldn't use it as a terminal yet, and it just wasn't any more convenient than checking my mobile.</p>

        <p>Skip forward to last summer, when I was browsing a flea-market in Charlottenburg, Berlin, when I came across a bunch of old Pocket-watches. I wanted one. I had no use for one, but I had a mighty need. That's when inspiration struck. The beauty of a pocket-watch terminal was too good to miss. I started searching for a pocket-watch that would match the size of the Moto 360. A week or two later: success!</p>

        <img alt="It's almost perfect. It was essential that the pocketwatch be slightly larger than the Moto360" src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/3836bc6bc73efe14420663ec5f87c340/tumblr_om5rf5a9GU1tucmhwo1_1280.jpg" width="700px;" style="float: center;" />
        
        <p>So the next step: tearing down both pieces. There's a bunch of pocket-watch disassembly videos on youtube. I used one similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYv8BLxpg8Y">this</a> one. I wasn't as careful as they are, but I had no intention of reassembling it, so I just needed to be careful not to harm the casing. When things got stuck, I levered them out, bending a couple of pieces in the process. This was the least of the “no going back now” moments in this build. Once the pocket-watch was completely hollow, consisting only of the frame, the glas face, and the two metal back pieces, I set them aside until I was done with the Moto 360.</p>
        
        <img alt="An aesthetic mess" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/4975a16ad0fa34fbb03974bf32e070fb/tumblr_om5rf5a9GU1tucmhwo2_r1_1280.jpg" width="700px" style="float: center;" />
        
        <p>There were two really helpful teardown videos for the smartwatch. One by <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Motorola+Moto+360+Teardown/28891">ifixit.com </a>, and one by <a hred="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcCB94volbA">adafruit</a>.
Both talk of heating up the watch first to soften the glue, but even after heating it as presented to a degree at which it was uncomfortable to hold the watch, I still couldnt lever the back from the watch without breaking it apart. With the back in pieces, I wasnt going to be wear it as a watch again comfortably any more. When I had eased the black plastic housing for the chip out of the casing, I disconnected it from the screen. It was just slightly too wide to fit into the hollow pocket-watch, so I took some pliers and clipped off most of the black plastic around the chip. The tear-downs were a little unclear on where the induction coil was, but I didnt need to get too close. After removing about 1-2 mm all around the rim, I was able to slip the entire thing into the housing.</p>
        <p>I removed the glass face of the pocket-watch when I realised that would obstruct both the touch-screen functionality, and also the housing from closing properly: I'd checked the diameter of the watches when buying the antique, but not the depth. Fortunately, with the glass removed, the screen slipped perfectly into the now empty frame. Before glueing it all together again, I needed to set up the pin to connect to the Moto360s side button. In the original Huber Pocket-watch, the pin turned a number of cogs in the mechanism, and so went pretty deep into the system. On the smartwatch though, it needed to only superficially touch the small button on the side of the chip. I used an angle-grinder to shorten the pin half an inch. Then, rotating the watch 90°, I aligned the button with the pin. It consistently shifted and missed the small button when pushed. Here's my (hacky) solution:</p>
        
        <img alt="You think this is ugly? Check out a mirror." src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/a35049b93b2de40d77197fdbbf8fa5f1/tumblr_om5rf5a9GU1tucmhwo3_r1_1280.jpg" width="600px" style="float: center;" />
        
        <p>I bent a piece of metal into shape and glued it in, so that the pin would inevitably press the metal plate which would press the button. Couple of tests: worked like a charm. I then went on to add hot-glue around the screen. Heated up the metal frame, lowered that down on top and added pressure with a wooden board and a clamp. Finished!</p>
        <br><br>
       
        <p>(you might notice there is a marred part of the frame surrounding the screen, which is where I used a blow torch to heat it for the hot-glue. Still need to find a method of pickling it without hurting the electronics)</p>
